# Smiling School - Implementing a design with bootstrap
In this project, we are implementing 3 web pages built with Bootstrap. We are tying together all the HTML/CSS/Accessibility/Responsive Design/and Bootstrap knowledge we have previously learned We are given freedom to implement the web page as we see fit, however we are to keep our CSS file as small as possible and rely on Bootstrap classes as much as we can. The 3 web pages final results are given to us as Figma designer files, and we are to recreate them. This project will be completed in one week.
## Requirements
- You have to use Bootstrap
- Your styles.css must be as small as you can - you must use as much as you can Bootstrap classes
## Final Results
These are what the final result of our pages should recreate in both the desktop and mobile versions of each page. The pages from left to right are the Homepage, Pricing page, and Courses page.

### Read and be familiar with Figma 
Create an account in Figma and open these files:
- [Homepage](https://www.figma.com/file/hcxMqRWjdj06jHycRkbzOf/Homepage?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&mode=design&t=iJoLzlFhrcbxSuHp-1)
- [Pricing](https://www.figma.com/file/QQmdkH49hKJuJ6244fBXzH/Pricing?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&mode=design&t=6DsY9JhEzAKi9umc-1)
- [Courses](https://www.figma.com/file/zKRy0vMRBjwHaKBn1WnavS/Courses?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&mode=design&t=tDcOvAFZroVFgXfH-1)

And “Duplicate to your Drafts” to have access to all design details.

Important notes with Figma:
- if your computer doesn’t have missing fonts, you can find them here: source-sans-pro and Spin-Cycle-OT
- some values are in float - feel free to round them
- “Be pixel perfect” - yes! but mainly make sure colors, size and position are correct. #C271FF is not purple.

For this task, please write an amazing README.md

Interactions note:
- Web pages must switch to the tablet version when the screen width is 768px
- Web pages must switch to the mobile version when the screen width is 576px
- button hover/active: opacity: 0.9
